# teepee - A Triple Pattern Fragment Profiler Visualization Tool

teepee is a Tool for visualizing the results generated by the TPF Profiler. It includes a simplified version of the TPF Profiler to generate results which can be visualuzed and analyzed using the provided tools.

## Available Demo

A running version of the demo can be found [here](http://km.aifb.kit.edu/services/teepee/).

## Local setup instructions

In this directory, the code for "teepee" is provided. To run the server, first the virtual environment provided in this repo needs to be activated:
````bash
. venv/bin/activate
```` 

The configuration file `demo_config.json` is used to setup the configuration for the available TPF servers and the maximum sample size for the TPF Profiler. 
For example, a configuration with a single TPF server to query the DBLP knowledge graph and a maximum sample size of 100:
```JSON
{
  "max_sample_size": 100,
  "tpf_servers":
    [
      {
        "name": "DBLP",
        "uri": "http://data.linkeddatafragments.org/dblp", 
        "backend": "HDT",
        "pagesize": "100",
        "environment": "remote"
      }
    ]
}
```
Please note, that the meta information about backend and pagesize need to be determined for each server by hand. 
The maximum sample size is set to 100 in the online demo due to performance reasons. 

After the configuration has beed adjusted, the server can be started using:

````bash
python webapp/app.py
```` 

The demo is then available at `http://localhost:5055/services/teepee/`.

To configure more TPF server, the `config/tpf_meta.json` can be edited and the server needs to be restarted.
